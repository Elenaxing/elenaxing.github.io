I truly enjoy and excel at planning detailed itineraries during my trips, making each journey well-organized and memorable.\n\n\n\nWith my firends during a weekend\n\n\n\n\nPainting\nI really like painting because I enjoy and relax in the process. And I can express emotions through painting that are sometimes difficult to describe in words. I took drawing lessons when I was a child, but now I paint mainly out of interest.\n\n\n\nMy recent painting\n\n\n\n\nSkiing\nI got into skiing when I came to Denver and quickly fell in love with the thrill it brings. I am currently at an intermediate level and enjoy challenging myself on different slopes.\n\n\n\nLOL! I fell down while skiing"
