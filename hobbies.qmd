### Traveling

Traveling allows me to experience new cultures, meet different people, and broaden my horizons. I truly enjoy and excel at planning detailed itineraries during my trips, making each journey well-organized and memorable.

### Painting
I really like painting because I enjoy and relax in the process. And I can express emotions through painting that are sometimes difficult to describe in words. I took drawing lessons when I was a child, but now I paint mainly out of interest.

### Skiing
I got into skiing when I came to Denver and quickly fell in love with the thrill it brings. I am currently at an intermediate level and enjoy challenging myself on different slopes.
